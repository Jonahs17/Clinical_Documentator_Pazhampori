Project Status : <b>Completed</b>

## About the Project
Generates clinical documentaion for a patient in PDF format from speech with the help of Google's SpeechRecognition, ChatGPT and fpdf module. Made for Parippuvada Hackathon conducted by GDSC CET. We created this project with the help of Google Colabs

## Reason for this topic
As healthcare is a very sensitive topic, AI at its current capabilities cannot be trusted to make important decisions like medicine prescription, diagnosis of disease, etc. as each and every decision should be minutely taken care of. This leaves us with how we can improve the lifestyle and overall effectiveness of medical professionals. Clinical Documentation is a sort of data entry process which takes up a lot of time of the professionals and AI can be really beneficial in this not-so-sensitive topic by reducing the workload of individuals. Our program is designed in a manner where the only requirement is that the professional recites the patient's details to the microphone which captures the audio and the output is a printable pdf file.

## Getting Started
