# Clinical_Documentator_Pazhampori
Clinical Documentation Maker with help of AI
This program uses OpenAI as its backend to produce the Documentation notes in a prescribed and formal format. The program is based on Speech-To-Text which is done using Google's SpeechRecognition. This converts the recorded audio file into text, which is feeded to the ChatGPT which inturn produces the output in a formal documentation format. The response is then made into a pdf format using fpdf module which is used for document generation. This ultimately produces a final output in pdf format, which even a person with very basic computer knowledge can interact easily.
Reason for the topic:
As healthcare is a very sensitive topic, AI at its current capabilities cannot be trusted to make important decisions like medicine prescription, diagnosis of disease, etc. as each and every decision should be minutely taken care of. This leaves us with how we can improve the lifestyle and overall effectiveness of medical professionals. Clinical Documentation is a sort of data entry process which takes up a lot of time of the professionals and AI can be really beneficial in this not-so-sensitive topic by reducing the workload of individuals. Our program is designed in a manner where the only requirement is that the professional recites the patient's details to the microphone which captures the audio and the output is a printable pdf file.
